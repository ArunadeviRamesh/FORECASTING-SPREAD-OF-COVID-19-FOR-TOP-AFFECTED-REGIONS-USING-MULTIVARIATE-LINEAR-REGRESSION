# FORECASTING-SPREAD-OF-COVID-19-FOR-TOP-AFFECTED-REGIONS-USING-MULTIVARIATE-LINEAR-REGRESSION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Chinaâ€™s Hubei province. The objective of this research is to propose a forecasting model using the COVID-19 available dataset from top affected regions across the world using machine learning algorithms. Machine Learning algorithms help us achieve this objective. Regression models are one of the supervised machine learning techniques to classify large-scale data. This research aims to apply Multivariate Linear Regression to predict the number of confirmed and death COVID-19 cases for a span of one and two weeks. The experimental results explain 99% variability in prediction with the R-squared statistics scores of 0.992. The algorithms are evaluated and compared using the error matrix such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and accuracy for top affected regions across the world.
